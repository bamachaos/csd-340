	Hello. My name is Patrick Cupp.  I live in Alabama where I am a Maintenance Manager in Supply Chain for the worlds largest retailer Walmart.
	I am married with four grown kids and nine grandchildren.</p>
	
	<p>My hobbies include camping, outdoor cooking, and anything computers.  I am actually taking these classes in an effort to land my retirement job.  
	My plan is to take on a remote job, where I can take my camper whereever I want to go, and as long as I have an internet connection still be able to work.</p>
	
	<p>I took my first programming class in 1985.  We used Microsoft Basic, an introductory programming language to get kids interested in programming.
	For whatever reason, I was pretty good at it and a hobby was born.  Since then I have learned to use Python (my favorite), C++, C#, Javascript, Ruby, HTML, and now learning CSS.</p>
	
	<p>A side project I am currently working on is building a website for my church.  While I have put together a few pages here and there this is the first fully functional
	website I have built.  <span class="sentence">This is also the reason for taking this class.</span>  Learning the process of putting together a website based on customer requirements has been a new experience for me.  Anything I have done before was
	simply to see if I could make it work.</p>
